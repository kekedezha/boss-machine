# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

In this project, I created an entire RESTful API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. I created routes to manage 'minions', brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to a busy schedule.

Project idea by Codecademy seen in their Full-Stack Course. Project steps and details are outlined below:

### API Routes

- Routes will live inside the **server** folder.
- The 'database' exists in **server/db.js**.

#### Routes Required

- `/api/minions`
  - GET /api/minions to get an array of all minions.
  - POST /api/minions to create a new minion and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/minions/:minionId to get a single minion by id.
  - PUT /api/minions/:minionId to update a single minion by id.
  - DELETE /api/minions/:minionId to delete a single minion by id.
- `/api/ideas`
  - GET /api/ideas to get an array of all ideas.
  - POST /api/ideas to create a new idea and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/ideas/:ideaId to get a single idea by id.
  - PUT /api/ideas/:ideaId to update a single idea by id.
  - DELETE /api/ideas/:ideaId to delete a single idea by id.
- `/api/meetings`
  - GET /api/meetings to get an array of all meetings.
  - POST /api/meetings to create a new meeting and save it to the database.
  - DELETE /api/meetings to delete _all_ meetings from the database.

### Working with the 'Database'

`getAllFromDatabase`:

- Takes only the single argument for model name. Returns the array of elements in the database or `null` if an invalid argument is supplied

`getFromDatabaseById`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second string argument representing the unique ID of the element. Returns the instance with valid inputs and `null` with an invalid id.

`addToDatabase`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second argument which is an object with the key-value pairs of the new instance. `addToDatabase` handles assigning `.id` properties to the instances. It does not check to make sure that valid inputs are supplied, so you will have to add those checks to your routes if necessary. `addToDatabase` will return the newly-created instance from the database. This function will validate the schema of the instance to create and throw an error if it is invalid.

`updateInstanceInDatabase`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second argument which is an object representing an updated instance. The instance provided must have a valid `.id` property which will be used to match. `updateInstanceInDatabase` will return the updated instance in the database or `null` with invalid inputs. This function will validate the schema of the updated instance and throw an error if it is invalid.

`deleteFromDatabasebyId`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second string argument representing the unique ID of the element to delete. Returns `true` if the delete occurs properly and `false` if the element is not found.

`deleteAllFromDatabase`:

- Takes only the single argument for model name. Deletes all elements from the proper model and returns a new, empty array. You will only need to use this function for a /api/meetings route.

#### Schemas

- Minion:
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - title: string
  - salary: number
- Idea
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - numWeeks: number
  - weeklyRevenue: number
- Meeting
  - time: string
  - date: JS `Date` object
  - day: string
  - note: string

### Custom Middleware

- `checkMillionDollarIdea` This function will make sure that any new or updated ideas are still worth at least one million dollars! The total value of an idea is the product of its `numWeeks` and `weeklyRevenue` properties.

### Bonus

As a bonus, the following routes were added to allow bosses to add and remove work from their minions' backlogs.

Schema:

- Work:
  - id: string
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - hours: number
  - minionId: string

Routes required:

- GET /api/minions/:minionId/work to get an array of all work for the specified minon.
- POST /api/minions/:minionId/work to create a new work object and save it to the database.
- PUT /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to update a single work by id.
- DELETE /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to delete a single work by id.
